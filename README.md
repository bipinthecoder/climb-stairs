# climb-stairs

### How to run
* Clone the repo
* Fill the Array X with skippable steps
* Replace input with number of steps in stair
* run "node index.js" to view the count

### Worst Case Time & Space Complexity
* Time Complexity : Depends on No.of steps and X-array size ~ O(N * X)
* SPace Complexity : O(N)
